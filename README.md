## üí∏ Motivation

## üíæ Install

Currently, `mathing` is only availabe via cloning on github and building from source via `cargo`. There are plans to (at least) package `mathing` for Nix/NixOs.

## üëê Usage

## üî® Configuration Files

The configuration directory stores all the data needed for `mathing` to run.  
This includes:

- `keymap.toml` : configuration file to map keystrokes to app actions.
- `data.db`: sqlite database.

By default, configuration files live in the `.config/mathing` directory on Mac and Linux.

- Configuration file location can be changed by setting the `MATHING_CONFIG` varaible.
- Run `mathing --help` to check where your config files are currently set to.

## üíª Keymap Configurations

`keymap.toml` is a file of _key event_ -> _command string_ pairs. By default, if `mathing` is run without a keymap file configured/present, the default keymap will be wirtten in the config directory.

Keys events consist of a key and a single otional modifer.  
Supported modifiers are:

- SHIFT
- CRTL
- ALT

`mathing` uses `crossterm` as its key event backent. You can read more about the key events at the [crossterm github page.](https://github.com/crossterm-rs/crossterm).

The following commands can be configured:
