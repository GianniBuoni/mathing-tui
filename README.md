## üí∏ Motivation

Expense splitting in the terminal! Woohoo!

Often grocery expenses are pretty consistent between me and my roomate. Week to week we usually end up getting the same staple items, and for the most part, quantities are variable. This was a exercise in rolling up a system that took that into account, by storing the various items we get, and perform the calculations for me.

As someone who likes living in the terminal, a TUI was a good vehicle for making something that I could lean a lot from while making, and for making something I would use often. **Key concepts I explored in building this app include**:

- SQLite databases and database testing using the [sqlx crate](https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx)
- Keymap configuration
- Hand rolling an API for sending Requests to the database and for handling the responses
- Input handling
- Concurrent programming/learning async Rust.

## üíæ Install

Currently, `mathing` is only availabe via cloning this repo and building from source via `cargo`. There are plans to (at least) package `mathing` for Nix/NixOs in the future.

## üëê Usage

Running `mathing` will pull up the main TUI. There are three tables the `Items`, `Receipts`, `Users`. Navigation and CRUD operations related to these tables are all handled via the keyboard. Commonly used key inputs and their corresponding actions are displayed at the bottom in a context menu.

New forms and confimation dialogue boxes pop up to help submit requests to the db. Form validation errors will prevent the form from submitting and will display the error at the bottom of the form. Other errors are displayed in a new dialogue box popup.

For a full list of commands, see the [keymap configuration](#-keymap-configurations) section for the full list of available actions.

## üî® Configuration Files

The configuration directory stores all the data persistant data needed for `mathing` to run. This includes:

- `keymap.toml` : configuration file to map keystrokes to app actions.
- `data.db`: sqlite database.

By default, configuration files live in the `.config/mathing` directory on Mac and Linux.

- Configuration file location can be changed by setting the `MATHING_CONFIG` varaible.
- Run `mathing --help` to check where your config files are currently set to.

## üíª Keymap Configurations

By default, if `mathing` is run without a keymap file configured/present, the default keymap.toml will be wirtten in the default system config directory.
`keymap.toml` is a file of _command string_ -> [_key string array_] pairs. Key strings are stored as arrays to allow the user to configure the same command to multiple key events.

For example:

```toml
NavigateLeft = ["h", "LEFT"]
NavigateDown = ["j", "DOWN"]
NavigateUp = ["k", "UP"]
NavigateRight = ["l", "RIGHT"]
Refresh = ["r"]
```

Mathing only supports keys events consisting of a key code and a single optional modifer.

Supported modifiers are:

- SHIFT
- CRTL
- ALT

`mathing` uses `crossterm` as its key event backend. You can read more about the key events at the [crossterm github page.](https://github.com/crossterm-rs/crossterm).

The following commands can be configured:
